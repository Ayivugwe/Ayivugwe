- DevOps Engineer/DevOps Envangelist: I have been in charge for implementing the DevOps culture in the coampny I used to work in. It has never been easy but as always, I face problems and never give up. This role was one of the most challenging responsibilities I've ever taken. After working as a Sotware Devoloper for almost 5 years, I was given this responisbility without knowing what was coming next. This role has been a key to my own life as I realised that people see me in a manner that I didn't think. What brought me to assuming this role? I shouldn't have an answer but my story is very long. I was not even expecting to work in this company but I asked for inerneship only. As the company was beasy to advance with projects, I was told that I should receive the interneship but there was no one to assist me. I decided to find intership else where. I did so. Almost one year after, I was called and it wasn't no more about internership but about job. Thank God, after many processes, I was hired not as a full employee but in a test period. And that's where my story starts a professional Software Developer. May God bless the CEO who decided to give me that occasion. I had to show my adaptability. It was never easy for someone without any other serious professional experience. As this was already a decisive challenge, I had no other choice but to adapt. I worked like hell and I was confirmed as a Junior Software Developer within six months. Then I turned a new page in my life. I worked for almost 5 years in that company in that same role and worked on multiple projects.
