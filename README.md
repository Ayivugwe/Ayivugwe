## My professional life
I have worked for only one employer my whole professional life from 2017 up to August 2023: that employer is a Tech Company called **ASYST Resources LTD**. It's situated in Bujumbura, the capital city of Burundi. I assumed 2 roles : 

- Software Developer and
- DevOps Envangelist & DevOps Engineer

  I was called Mr. DevOps. I have been in charge for implementing the DevOps culture in that company. It was not easy but as always, I face problems and never give up. This role was one of the most challenging responsibilities I've ever taken. At a given point I was called the **Guardian of the temple.** By this you may understand that I had almost all the confidence and trust from the company management. To be clear and true, I was given almost every responsibility you may think of until I was asking myself what the CEO saw in me. I was in charge of our cloud accounts like GitHub, Atlassian (Jira and Confluence), implementing the best practices, the choice of the tools to use, and many other responisibilities. You may think that we had a very small team that's why I had to assume all those responsibilities; but no. At a given point we where more than 50 developers. Ahhh! Yes. And I was beeing given all those those responsibilities. Why that? One day the CEO called me in his office and told me that I may have other side effects but that I'm an authentic man.   

  As a DevOps, I was in charge of: 
  - Java Backend code review
  - GitHub Administrator
  - Jira and Confluence Administrator
  - Slack Administrator
  - AWS Administrator
  - In charge of the deployments
  - Hiring Interview : I was sometimes tasked with studying submissions of those who need to work in the company.

## My Story as a DevOps 
After working as a Sotware Devoloper for almost 5 years, I was given this responisbility without knowing what was coming next. This role has been a key to my own life as I realised that people see me in a manner that I didn't think. What brought me to assuming this role? I shouldn't have an answer but my story is very long. I was not even expecting to work in this company but I asked for inerneship only. As the company was beasy to advance with projects, I was told that I should receive the interneship but there was no one to assist me. I decided to find intership else where. I did so. Almost one year after, I was called and it wasn't no more about internership but about job. Thank God, after many processes, I was hired not as a full employee but in a test period. And that's where my story starts a professional Software Developer. May God bless the CEO who decided to give me that occasion. I had to show my adaptability. It was never easy for someone without any other serious professional experience. As this was already a decisive challenge, I had no other choice but to adapt. I worked like hell and I was confirmed as a Junior Software Developer within six months. Then I turned a new page in my life. I worked for almost 5 years in that company in that same role and worked on multiple projects.

## Languages that I speak
- **Kifuliiru** :  
This is my mother tongue. By wanting to find things on the Internet in my own language, I found myself doing things I didn't know. This is my gratest  source of inspiration. I want to put my language everywhere, then I have to work hard. Search for the word : **Ibufuliiru** or **Kifuliiru** to see by yourself. 

- Kiswahili
- English
- French
- Spanish (Medium level, due to not practicing)
- Esperanto (limited due to not practicing)

Most of the time I'm constantly thinking about a solution to help my mother tongue Kifuliiru to not perish. I write a lot in this language and you can at least see my writings on this different website and platfoms: 

- [Kifuliiru](https://ibufuliiru.editorx.io/kifuliiru/?target=_blank)
- [Tusome i Kifuliiru](https://tusome-i-kifuliiru.vercel.app/){:target="_blank"}
- [Imyazi mu Kifuliiru](https://ibufuliiru.editorx.io/imyazi){:target="_blank"}
- [Ibufuliiru](https://ibufuliiru.editorx.io/ibufuliiru/){:target="_blank"}
- [Imyazi ye'Radio Ibufuliiru](https://radioibufuliiru.substack.com/){:target="_blank"}

I'm using all my knowledge to bring this idea to life. You may want to contribute on the different projects I'm working on for this language, you are welcome. I have a flutter mobile app project using FlutterFlow.
